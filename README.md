# Desktop_Assistant   
 I'm trying to make it because I'm inspired by the Shimeji, and I think it'd be nice to provide them with tools that make it easier to use the computer.
 
 **! Important !**   
 To adapt to Winform and c#, I'm using the features I've learned personally, and I'm just making them for my own use, so I'm just making them for learning!
